If that's not the case, it will automatically be downloaded by the \nxcode_install\n gem.\n\n\nThis will make sure to use the correct Xcode for later actions.\n\n\nxcode_install(version: \n7.1\n)\n\n\n\n\nxcversion\n\n\nFinds and selects a version of an installed Xcode that best matches the provided \nGem::Version\n requirement specifier\n.\n\n\nxcversion version: \n7.1\n # Selects Xcode 7.1.0\nxcversion version: \n~\n 7.1.0\n # Selects the latest installed version from the 7.1.x set\n\n\n\n\nxcode_select\n\n\nSelect and build with the Xcode installed at the provided path. Use the \nxcversion\n action if you want to select an Xcode based on a version specifier or you don't have known, stable paths as may happen in a CI environment.\n\n\nxcode_select \n/Applications/Xcode6.1.app\n\n\n\n\n\nresign\n\n\nThis will resign an ipa with another signing identity and provisioning profile.\n\n\nIf you have used the \nipa\n and \nsigh\n actions, then this action automatically gets the \nipa\n and \nprovisioning_profile\n values respectively from those actions and you don't need to manually set them (although you can always override them).\n\n\nresign(\n  ipa: 'path/to/ipa', # can omit if using the `ipa` action\n  signing_identity: 'iPhone Distribution: Luka Mirosevic (0123456789)',\n  provisioning_profile: 'path/to/profile', # can omit if using the `sigh` action\n)\n\n\n\n\nYou may provide multiple provisioning profiles if the application contains nested applications or app extensions, which need their own provisioning profile. You can do so by passing an array of provisioning profile strings or a hash that associates provisioning profile values to bundle identifier keys.\n\n\nresign(\n  ipa: 'path/to/ipa', # can omit if using the `ipa` action\n  signing_identity: 'iPhone Distribution: Luka Mirosevic (0123456789)',\n  provisioning_profile: {\n    'com.example.awesome-app' =\n 'path/to/profile',\n    'com.example.awesome-app.app-extension' =\n 'path/to/app-extension/profile'\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\ncreate_keychain\n\n\nCreate a new keychain, which can then be used to import certificates.\n\n\ncreate_keychain(\n  name: \nKeychainName\n,\n  default_keychain: true,\n  unlock: true,\n  timeout: 3600,\n  lock_when_sleeps: true\n)\n\n\n\n\nunlock_keychain\n\n\nUnlock an existing keychain and add it to the keychain search list.\n\n\nunlock_keychain(\n  path: \n/path/to/KeychainName.keychain\n,\n  password: \nmysecret\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nBy default the keychain is added to the existing. To replace them with the selected keychain you may use \n:replace\n.\n\n\nunlock_keychain(\n  path: \n/path/to/KeychainName.keychain\n,\n  password: \nmysecret\n,\n  add_to_search_list: :replace # To only add a keychain use `true` or `:add`.\n)\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the keychain can be selected as a default keychain.\n\n\nunlock_keychain(\n  path: \n/path/to/KeychainName.keychain\n,\n  password: \nmysecret\n,\n  set_default: true\n)\n\n\n\n\nIf the keychain file is located in the standard location \n~/Library/Keychains\n, then it is sufficient to provide the keychain file name, or file name with its suffix.\n\n\nunlock_keychain(\n  path: \nKeychainName\n,\n  password: \nmysecret\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nget_ipa_info_plist_value\n\n\nReturns a value from Info.plist inside a .ipa file\n\n\nget_ipa_info_plist_value(ipa: \npath.ipa\n, key: \nKEY_YOU_READ\n)\n\n\n\n\ndelete_keychain\n\n\nDelete a keychain, can be used after creating one with \ncreate_keychain\n.\n\n\ndelete_keychain(name: \nKeychainName\n)\n\n\n\n\nimport_certificate\n\n\nImport certificates into the current default keychain.

Supported options are: 1) \n:standard\n, this is the default and will output pretty colored UTF8, and 2) \n:basic\n, which will output monochrome ASCII, useful for a CI environment like TeamCity that doesn't support color/UTF8.\n\n\nxcodebuild(\n  workspace: \n...\n,\n  scheme: \n...\n,\n  build_settings: {\n    \nCODE_SIGN_IDENTITY\n =\n \niPhone Developer: ...\n,\n    \nPROVISIONING_PROFILE\n =\n \n...\n,\n    \nJOBS\n =\n 16\n  },\n  output_style: :basic\n)\n\n\n\n\nTo keep your Fastfile lightweight, there are also alias actions available for\nthe most common \nxcodebuild\n operations: \nxcarchive\n, \nxcbuild\n, \nxcclean\n, \nxctest\n \n \nxcexport\n.\n\n\nTo export the IPA files using \nxcodebuild\n you can provide \n:export_options_plist\n as a path to plist file or as a hash of values. To get the list of available keys and values please read help page: \nxcodebuild --help\n:\n\n\nxcexport(\n  archive_path: \n...\n,\n  export_options_plist: \n/path/to/export_options.plist\n\n)\n\n# or\nxcexport(\n  archive_path: \n...\n,\n  export_options_plist: {\n    method: \nad-hoc\n,\n    thinning: \nthin-for-all-variants\n,\n    manifest: {\n      appURL: \nhttps://example.com/path/MyApp Name.ipa\n,\n      displayImageURL: \nhttps://example.com/display image.png\n,\n      fullSizeImageURL: \nhttps://example.com/fullSize image.png\n,\n    }\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\nWhen using \n:export_options_plist\n as hash, the \n:teamID\n is read from \nAppfile\n. \n:appURL\n, \n:displayImageURL\n, \n:fullSizeImageURL\n, \n:assetPackManifestURL\n and \n:onDemandResourcesAssetPacksBaseURL\n are URI escaped to prevent Xcode errors.\n\n\nEnvironment variables may be added to a .env file in place of some parameters:\n\n\nXCODE_PROJECT=\n./MyApp.xcodeproj\n\nXCODE_WORKSPACE=\n./MyApp.xcworkspace\n\nXCODE_SCHEME=\nMyApp\n\nXCODE_BUILD_PATH=\n./build\n\n\n\n\n\nMore usage examples (assumes the above .env setup is being used):\n\n\n  # Clean the project\n  xcclean\n\n  # Build the project\n  xcbuild\n\n  # Run tests in given simulator\n  xctest(\n    destination: \nname=iPhone 5s,OS=8.1\n\n  )\n\n  # Create an archive (./build-dir/MyApp.xcarchive)\n  xcarchive\n\n  # Export a signed binary (./build-dir/MyApp.ipa)\n  xcexport\n\n\n\n\nSee how \nWikipedia\n uses the \nxctest\n action to test their app.\n\n\nNote\n: \nxcodebuild\n is a complex command, so it is recommended to use \ngym\n for building your ipa file and \nscan\n for testing your app instead.\n\n\ncopy_artifacts\n\n\nThis action copies artifacs to a target directory. It's useful if you have a CI that will pick up these artifacts and attach them to the build. Useful e.g. for storing your \n.ipa\ns, \n.dSYM.zip\ns, \n.mobileprovision\ns, \n.cert\ns\n\n\nMake sure your target_path is gitignored, and if you use \nreset_git_repo\n, make sure the artifacts are added to the exclude list\n\n\nExample in conjunction with reset_git_repo\n\n\n# Move our artifacts to a safe location so TeamCity can pick them up\ncopy_artifacts(\n  target_path: 'artifacts',\n  artifacts: ['*.cer', '*.mobileprovision', '*.ipa', '*.dSYM.zip']\n)\n\n# Reset the git repo to a clean state, but leave our artifacts in place\nreset_git_repo(\n  exclude: 'artifacts'\n)\n\n\n\n\nclean_build_artifacts\n\n\nThis action deletes the files that get created in your repo as a result of running the \nipa\n and \nsigh\n commands. It doesn't delete the \nfastlane/report.xml\n though, this is probably more suited for the .gitignore.\n\n\nUseful if you quickly want to send out a test build by dropping down to the command line and typing something like \nfastlane beta\n, without leaving your repo in a messy state afterwards.\n\n\nclean_build_artifacts\n\n\n\n\nSee how \nArtsy\n cleans their build artifacts after building and distributing their app.\n\n\nframeit\n\n\nBy default, the device color will be black\n\n\nframeit\n\n\n\n\nTo use white (sorry, silver) device frames\n\n\nframeit :silver\n\n\n\n\nSee how \nMindNode\n uses \nframeit\n to not only frame the screenshots, but also add a title and a background around the screenshots. More information available in their \nFastfile\n and the \nscreenshots folder\n (\nFramefile.json\n)\n\n\ndsym_zip\n\n\nCreate a zipped dSYM file from your \n.xcarchive\n, useful if you use the \nxcodebuild\n action in combination with \ncrashlytics\n or \nhockey\n.\n\n\ndsym_zip\n\n\n\n\nYou can manually specify the path to the xcarchive (not needed if you use \nxcodebuild\n/\nxcarchive\n to build your archive):\n\n\ndsym_zip(\n  archive_path: 'MyApp.xcarchive'\n)\n\n\n\n\nsplunkmint\n\n\nUploads dSYM.zip file to \nSplunk MINT\n for crash symbolication.\n\n\nsplunkmint(\n    dsym: \nMy.app.dSYM.zip\n,\n    api_key: \n43564d3a\n,\n    api_token: \ne05456234c4869fb7e0b61\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nIf you use \ngym\n the \ndsym\n parameter is optional.\n\n\nrecreate_schemes\n\n\nRecreate shared Xcode project schemes if the \nShared\n checkbox was not enabled.\n\n\nrecreate_schemes(\n  project: './path/to/MyApp.xcodeproj'\n)\n\n\n\n\nTesting\n\n\nscan\n\n\nscan\n makes it super easy to run tests of your iOS and Mac applications\n\n\nscan\n\n\n\n\nYou can define all options that are available in \nscan --help\n\n\nscan(\n  workspace: \nApp.xcworkspace\n,\n  scheme: \nMyTests\n,\n  clean: false\n)\n\n\n\n\nxctest\n\n\nUse the \nxctest\n command to run unit tests.\n\n\nWhen running tests, coverage reports can be generated via \nxcpretty\n reporters:\n\n\n  # Run tests in given simulator\n  xctest(\n    destination: \nname=iPhone 5s,OS=8.1\n,\n    destination_timeout: 120, # increase device/simulator timeout, usually used on slow CI boxes\n    reports: [{\n      report: 'html',\n      output: './build-dir/test-report.html',  # will use XCODE_BUILD_PATH/report, if output is not provided\n      screenshots: 1\n    },\n    {\n      report: 'junit',\n      output: './build-dir/test-report.xml'\n    }]\n  )\n\n\n\n\nxctool\n\n\nYou can run any \nxctool\n action.

It's extra useful if you use it to download the latest dSYM files from Apple when you use Bitcode.\n\n\nupload_symbols_to_crashlytics(dsym_path: \n./App.dSYM.zip\n)\n\n\n\n\nupload_symbols_to_sentry\n\n\nThis action allows you to upload symbolication files to Sentry.\n\n\nupload_symbols_to_sentry(\n  auth_token: '...',\n  org_slug: '...',\n  project_slug: '...',\n  dsym_path: './App.dSYM.zip'\n)\n\n\n\n\nThe following environment variables may be used in place of parameters: \nSENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN\n, \nSENTRY_ORG_SLUG\n, \nSENTRY_PROJECT_SLUG\n, and \nSENTRY_DSYM_PATH\n.\n\n\nAWS S3 Distribution\n\n\nUpload a new build to Amazon S3 to distribute the build to beta testers. Works for both Ad Hoc and Enterprise signed applications. This step will generate the necessary HTML, plist, and version files for you.\n\n\nAdd the \ns3\n action after the \nipa\n step:\n\n\ns3\n\n\n\n\nYou can also customize a lot of options:\n\n\ns3(\n  # All of these are used to make Shenzhen's `ipa distribute:s3` command\n  access_key: ENV['S3_ACCESS_KEY'],               # Required from user.\n  secret_access_key: ENV['S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'], # Required from user.\n  bucket: ENV['S3_BUCKET'],                       # Required from user.\n  ipa: 'AppName.ipa',                             # Optional is you use `ipa` to build\n  dsym: 'AppName.app.dSYM.zip',                   # Optional is you use `ipa` to build\n  path: 'v{CFBundleShortVersionString}_b{CFBundleVersion}/', # This is actually the default.\n  upload_metadata: true,                          # Upload version.json, plist and HTML. Set to false to skip uploading of these files.\n  version_file_name: 'app_version.json',          # Name of the file to upload to S3. Defaults to 'version.json'\n  version_template_path: 'path/to/erb'            # Path to an ERB to configure the structure of the version JSON file\n)\n\n\n\n\nIt is recommended to \nnot\n store the AWS access keys in the \nFastfile\n.\n\n\nThe uploaded \nversion.json\n file provides an easy way for apps to poll if a new update is available. The JSON looks like:\n\n\n{\n    \nlatestVersion\n: \n%= full_version %\n,\n    \nupdateUrl\n: \nitms-services://?action=download-manifest\nurl=\n%= url %\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nDeployGate\n\n\nYou can retrieve your username and API token on \nyour settings page\n.\n\n\ndeploygate(\n  api_token: '...',\n  user: 'target username or organization name',\n  ipa: './ipa_file.ipa',\n  message: \nBuild #{lane_context[SharedValues::BUILD_NUMBER]}\n,\n  distribution_key: '(Optional) Target Distribution Key'\n)\n\n\n\n\nIf you put \ndeploygate\n after \nipa\n action, you don't have to specify IPA file path, as it is extracted from the lane context automatically.\n\n\nMore information about the available options can be found in the \nDeployGate Push API document\n.\n\n\nXcode Server\n\n\nThis action retrieves integration assets (\n.xcarchive\n, logs etc) from your Xcode Server instance over HTTPS.\n\n\nxcode_server_get_assets(\n    host: '10.99.0.59', # Specify Xcode Server's Host or IP Address\n    bot_name: 'release-1.3.4' # Specify the particular Bot\n  )\n\n\n\n\nThis allows you to use Xcode Server for building and testing, which can be useful when your build takes a long time and requires connected iOS devices for testing. This action only requires you specify the \nhost\n and the \nbot_name\n and it will go and download, unzip and return a path to the downloaded folder. Then you can export an IPA from the archive and upload it with \ndeliver\n.\n\n\nRun \nfastlane action xcode_server_get_assets\n for the full list of options.\n\n\nset_changelog\n\n\nTo easily set the changelog of an app on iTunes Connect for all languages\n\n\nset_changelog(app_identifier: \ncom.krausefx.app\n, version: \n1.0\n, changelog: \nAll Languages\n)\n\n\n\n\nYou can store the changelog in \n./fastlane/changelog.txt\n and it will automatically get loaded from there. This integration is useful if you support e.g. 10 languages and want to use the same \"What's new\"-text for all languages.\n\n\nmake_changelog_from_jenkins\n\n\nGenerate a changelog using the Changes section the running Jenkins job.\n\n\nmake_changelog_from_jenkins(\n  # Optional, lets you set a changelog in the case is not generated on Jenkins or if ran outside of Jenkins\n  fallback_changelog: \nBug fixes and performance enhancements\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Releases\n\n\nThis action creates a new release for your repository on GitHub and can also upload specified assets like \n.ipa\ns and \n.app\ns, binary files, changelogs etc.\n\n\ngithub_release = set_github_release(\n  repository_name: \nfastlane/fastlane\n,\n  api_token: ENV['GITHUB_TOKEN'],\n  name: \nSuper New actions\n,\n  tag_name: \nv1.22.0\n,\n  description: File.read(\nchangelog\n),\n  commitish: \nmaster\n,\n  upload_assets: [\nexample_integration.ipa\n, \n./pkg/built.gem\n]\n)\n\n\n\n\nartifactory\n\n\nThis allows you to upload your ipa, or any other file you want, to artifactory.\n\n\nartifactory(\n  username: \nusername\n,\n  password: \npassword\n,\n  endpoint: \nhttps://artifactory.example.com/artifactory/\n,\n  file: 'example.ipa',                                # File to upload\n  repo: 'mobile_artifacts',                           # Artifactory repo\n  repo_path: '/ios/appname/example-major.minor.ipa'   # Path to place the artifact including its filename\n)\n\n\n\n\nTo get a list of all available parameters run \nfastlane action artifactory\n\n\nnexus_upload\n\n\nUpload your ipa, or any other file you want, to Sonatype Nexus platform.\n\n\nnexus_upload(\n  file: \n/path/to/file.ipa\n,\n  repo_id: \nartefacts\n,\n  repo_group_id: \ncom.fastlane\n,\n  repo_project_name: \nipa\n,\n  repo_project_version: \n1.13\n,\n  repo_classifier: \ndSYM\n, # Optional\n  endpoint: \nhttp://localhost:8081\n,\n  username: \nadmin\n,\n  password: \nadmin123\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nAppetize.io\n\n\nUpload your zipped app to Appetize.io to stream your app in the browser.\n\n\nappetize(\n  path: './MyApp.zip',\n  api_token: 'yourapitoken', # get it from https://appetize.io/docs#request-api-token\n  public_key: 'your_public_key' # get it from https://appetize.io/dashboard\n)\n\n\n\n\nIf you provide a \npublic_key\n, this will overwrite an existing application.

Especially useful to put at the beginning of your Fastfile in the \nbefore_all\n block, if some of your other actions will touch your filesystem, do things to your git repo, or just as a general reminder to save your work. Also needed as a prerequisite for some other actions like \nreset_git_repo\n.\n\n\nensure_git_status_clean\n\n\n\n\nWikipedia\n uses \nensure_git_status_clean\n to make sure, no uncommited changes are deployed by `fastlane.\n\n\ncommit_version_bump\n\n\nThis action will create a \"Version Bump\" commit in your repo. Useful in conjunction with \nincrement_build_number\n.\n\n\nIt checks the repo to make sure that only the relevant files have changed, these are the files that \nincrement_build_number\n (\nagvtool\n) touches:\n- All .plist files\n- The \n.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj\n file\n\n\nThen commits those files to the repo.\n\n\nCustomise the message with the \n:message\n option, defaults to \"Version Bump\"\n\n\nIf you have other uncommitted changes in your repo, this action will fail. If you started off in a clean repo, and used the \nipa\n and or \nsigh\n actions, then you can use the \nclean_build_artifacts\n action to clean those temporary files up before running this action.\n\n\ncommit_version_bump\n\ncommit_version_bump(\n  message: 'Version Bump',                    # create a commit with a custom message\n  xcodeproj: './path/to/MyProject.xcodeproj', # optional, if you have multiple Xcode project files, you must specify your main project here\n)\n\n\n\n\nArtsy\n uses \nfastlane\n to automatically commit the version bump, add a new git tag and push everything back to \nmaster\n.\n\n\nnumber_of_commits\n\n\nYou can use this action to get the number of commits of this repo. This is useful if you want to set the build number to the number of commits.\n\n\nbuild_number = number_of_commits\nincrement_build_number(build_number: build_number)\n\n\n\n\nadd_git_tag\n\n\nThis will automatically tag your build with the following format: \ngrouping\n/\nlane\n/\nprefix\nbuild_number\n, where:\n\n\n\n\ngrouping\n is just to keep your tags organised under one \"folder\", defaults to 'builds'\n\n\nlane\n is the name of the current fastlane lane\n\n\nprefix\n is anything you want to stick in front of the version number, e.g. \"v\"\n\n\nbuild_number\n is the build number, which defaults to the value emitted by the \nincrement_build_number\n action\n\n\n\n\nFor example for build 1234 in the \"appstore\" lane it will tag the commit with \nbuilds/appstore/1234\n\n\nadd_git_tag # simple tag with default values\n\nadd_git_tag(\n  grouping: 'fastlane-builds',\n  prefix: 'v',\n  build_number: 123\n)\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can specify your own tag. Note that if you do specify a tag, all other arguments are ignored.\n\n\nadd_git_tag(\n  tag: 'my_custom_tag'\n)\n\n\n\n\nArtsy\n uses \nfastlane\n to automatically commit the version bump, add a new git tag and push everything back to \nmaster\n.\n\n\ngit_pull\n\n\nExecutes a simple \ngit pull --tags\n command\n\n\npush_to_git_remote\n\n\nLets you push your local commits to a remote git repo. Useful if you make local changes such as adding a version bump commit (using \ncommit_version_bump\n) or a git tag (using 'add_git_tag') on a CI server, and you want to push those changes back to your canonical/main repo.\n\n\nTags will be pushed as well by default, except when setting the option 'tags' to false.\n\n\npush_to_git_remote # simple version. pushes 'master' branch to 'origin' remote\n\npush_to_git_remote(\n  remote: 'origin',         # optional, default: 'origin'\n  local_branch: 'develop',  # optional, aliased by 'branch', default: 'master'\n  remote_branch: 'develop', # optional, default is set to local_branch\n  force: true,              # optional, default: false\n  tags: false               # optional, default: true\n)\n\n\n\n\nArtsy\n uses \nfastlane\n to automatically commit the version bump, add a new git tag and push everything back to \nmaster\n.\n\n\npush_git_tags\n\n\nIf you only want to push the tags and nothing else, you can use the \npush_git_tags\n action:\n\n\npush_git_tags\n\n\n\n\nreset_git_repo\n\n\nThis action will reset your git repo to a clean state, discarding any uncommitted and untracked changes. Useful in case you need to revert the repo back to a clean state, e.g. after the fastlane run.\nUntracked files like \n.env\n will also be deleted, unless \n:skip_clean\n is true.\n\n\nIt's a pretty drastic action so it comes with a sort of safety latch. It will only proceed with the reset if either of these conditions are met:\n\n\n\n\nYou have called the \nensure_git_status_clean\n action prior to calling this action. This ensures that your repo started off in a clean state, so the only things that will get destroyed by this action are files that are created as a byproduct of the fastlane run.\n\n\nYou call it with the \nforce: true\n option, in which case \"you have been warned\".\n\n\n\n\nAlso useful for putting in your \nerror\n block, to bring things back to a pristine state (again with the caveat that you have called \nensure_git_status_clean\n before)\n\n\nreset_git_repo\nreset_git_repo(force: true) # If you don't care about warnings and are absolutely sure that you want to discard all changes. This will reset the repo even if you have valuable uncommitted changes, so use with care!\nreset_git_repo(skip_clean: true) # If you want 'git clean' to be skipped, thus NOT deleting untracked files like '.env'. Optional, defaults to false.\n\n# You can also specify a list of files that should be reset.\nreset_git_repo(\n  force: true,\n  files: [\n    \n./file.txt\n\n  ])\n\n\n\n\nMindNode\n uses this action to reset temporary changes of the project configuration after successfully building it.\n\n\nget_github_release\n\n\nYou can easily receive information about a specific release from GitHub.com\n\n\nrelease = get_github_release(url: \nfastlane/fastlane\n, version: \n1.0.0\n)\nputs release['name']\n\n\n\n\nTo get a list of all available values run \nfastlane action get_github_release\n.\n\n\nimport_from_git\n\n\nImport another Fastfile from a remote git repository to use its lanes.\n\n\nThis is useful if you have shared lanes across multiple apps and you want to store the Fastfile in a remote git repository.\n\n\nimport_from_git(\n  url: 'git@github.com:fastlane/fastlane.git', # The url of the repository to import the Fastfile from.\n  branch: 'HEAD', # The branch to checkout on the repository. Defaults to `HEAD`.\n  path: 'fastlane/Fastfile' # The path of the Fastfile in the repository. Defaults to `fastlane/Fastfile`.\n)\n\n\n\n\nlast_git_commit\n\n\nGet information about the last git commit, returns the commit hash, the abbreviated commit hash, the author and the git message.\n\n\ncommit = last_git_commit\ncrashlytics(notes: commit[:message]) # message of commit\nauthor = commit[:author] # author of the commit\nhash = commit[:commit_hash] # long sha of commit\nshort_hash = commit[:abbreviated_commit_hash] # short sha of commit\n\n\n\n\ncreate_pull_request\n\n\nCreate a new pull request.\n\n\ncreate_pull_request(\n  api_token: ENV['GITHUB_TOKEN'],\n  repo: 'fastlane/fastlane',\n  title: 'Amazing new feature',\n  head: 'my-feature',                 # optional, defaults to current branch name.\n  base: 'master',                     # optional, defaults to 'master'.\n  body: 'Please pull this in!',       # optional\n  api_url: 'http://yourdomain/api/v3' # optional, for Github Enterprise, defaults to 'https://api.github.com'.\n)\n\n\n\n\nUsing mercurial\n\n\nhg_ensure_clean_status\n\n\nAlong the same lines as the \nensure_git_status_clean\n action, this is a sanity check to ensure the working mercurial repo is clean. Especially useful to put at the beginning of your Fastfile in the \nbefore_all\n block.\n\n\nhg_ensure_clean_status\n\n\n\n\nhg_commit_version_bump\n\n\nThe mercurial equivalent of the \ncommit_version_bump\n git action. Like the git version, it is useful in conjunction with \nincrement_build_number\n.\n\n\nIt checks the repo to make sure that only the relevant files have changed, these are the files that \nincrement_build_number\n (\nagvtool\n) touches:\n- All .plist files\n- The \n.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj\n file\n\n\nThen commits those files to the repo.\n\n\nCustomise the message with the \n:message\n option, defaults to \"Version Bump\"\n\n\nIf you have other uncommitted changes in your repo, this action will fail. If you started off in a clean repo, and used the \nipa\n and or \nsigh\n actions, then you can use the \nclean_build_artifacts\n action to clean those temporary files up before running this action.\n\n\nhg_commit_version_bump\n\nhg_commit_version_bump(\n  message: 'Version Bump',                    # create a commit with a custom message\n  xcodeproj: './path/to/MyProject.xcodeproj', # optional, if you have multiple Xcode project files, you must specify your main project here\n)\n\n\n\n\nhg_add_tag\n\n\nA simplified version of git action \nadd_git_tag\n. It adds a given tag to the mercurial repo.\n\n\nSpecify the tag name with the \n:tag\n option.\n\n\nhg_add_tag tag: version_number\n\n\n\n\nhg_push\n\n\nThe mercurial equivalent of \npush_to_git_remote\n \u2014 pushes your local commits to a remote mercurial repo.

If an update was performed, fastlane will be restarted before the run continues.\n\n\nIf you are using rbenv or rvm, everything should be good to go. However, if you are using the system's default ruby, some additional setup is needed for this action to work correctly. In short, fastlane needs to be able to access your gem library without running in \nsudo\n mode.\n\n\nThe simplest possible fix for this is putting the following lines into your \n~/.bashrc\n or \n~/.zshrc\n file:\n\n\nexport GEM_HOME=~/.gems\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.gems/bin\n\n\n\n\nAfter the above changes, restart your terminal, then run \nmkdir $GEM_HOME\n to create the new gem directory. After this, you're good to go!\n\n\nRecommended usage of the \nupdate_fastlane\n action is at the top of the \nbefore_all\n block, before running any other action:\n\n\nbefore_all do\n  update_fastlane\n\n  cocoapods\n  increment_build_number\n  ...\nend\n\n\n\n\nsonar\n\n\nThis action will execute \nsonar-runner\n to run SonarQube analysis on your source code.\n\n\nsonar(\n  project_key: \nname.gretzki.awesomeApp\n,\n  project_version: \n1.0\n,\n  project_name: \niOS - AwesomeApp\n,\n  sources_path: File.expand_path(\n../AwesomeApp\n)\n)\n\n\n\n\nIt can process unit test results if formatted as junit report as shown in \nxctest\n action. It can also integrate coverage reports in Cobertura format, which can be transformed into by \nslather\n action.\n\n\nsetup_jenkins\n\n\nThis action helps with Jenkins integration. Creates own derived data for each job. All build results like IPA files and archives will be stored in the \n./output\n directory. The action also works with \nKeychains and Provisioning Profiles Plugin\n, selected keychain will be automatically unlocked and the selected code signing identity will be used. By default this action will only work when fastlane is executed on a CI system.\n\n\nsetup_jenkins\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\nadb\n\n\nLets you execute adb commands.\n\n\nadb(\n  command: \nshell ls\n,\n)\n\n\n\n\nadb_devices\n\n\nReturns an array of all currently connected android devices.\ne.g.: run an adb command on all connected devices.\n\n\nadb_devices.each  do | device |\n  model = adb(command: \nshell getprop ro.product.model\n,\n              serial: device.serial\n             ).strip\n  puts \nModel #{model} is connected\n\nend\n\n\n\n\ntwitter\n\n\nPost a tweet on twitter.

This action is a wrapper around the cloc tool:\n\n\n# Result will be an XML report file: reports/cloc.xml\ncloc(exclude_dir: 'ThirdParty,Resources', output_directory: 'reports', source_directory: 'MyCoolApp')\n\n\n\n\nis_ci?\n\n\nIs the current run being executed on a CI system, like Jenkins or Travis?\n\n\nif is_ci?\n  puts \nI'm a computer\n\nelse\n  say \nHi Human!\n\nend\n\n\n\n\nverify_build\n\n\nVerifies that the built app was built using the expected build resources. This is relevant for people who build on machines that are used to build apps with different profiles, certificates and/or bundle identifiers to guard against configuration mistakes.\n\n\nAdd this action to appropriate lanes and assign some values to verify, like:\n\n\nverify_build(\n  provisioning_type: 'distribution',\n  bundle_identifier: 'com.example.myapp'\n)\n\n\n\n\nYou can verify the following items:\n- app_name\n- bundle_identifier\n- provisioning_type\n- provisioning_uuid\n- team_identifier\n- team_name\n\n\nverify_pod_keys\n\n\nRuns a check against all keys specified in your Podfile to make sure they're more than a single character long. This is to ensure you don't deploy with stubbed keys.\n\n\nverify_pod_keys\n\n\n\n\nWill raise an error if any key is empty or a single character.\n\n\nread_podspec\n\n\nLoads the specified (or the first found) podspec in the folder as JSON, so that you can inspect its \nversion\n, \nfiles\n etc. This can be useful when basing your release process on the version string only stored in one place - in the podspec.

If an update was performed, fastlane will be restarted before the run continues.  If you are using rbenv or rvm, everything should be good to go. However, if you are using the system's default ruby, some additional setup is needed for this action to work correctly. In short, fastlane needs to be able to access your gem library without running in  sudo  mode.  The simplest possible fix for this is putting the following lines into your  ~/.bashrc  or  ~/.zshrc  file:  export GEM_HOME=~/.gems\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.gems/bin  After the above changes, restart your terminal, then run  mkdir $GEM_HOME  to create the new gem directory. After this, you're good to go!

Then you create a second build plan \nProject - Fastlane\n that pulls down the \nCarthage\n directory and runs \nfastlane\n.  \n\n\nArtifact Plan\n\n\nUse a very simple setup to create this build plan.  First off you want to make sure this plan is manually triggered only - because you only need to run it whenever the \nCartfile\n changes as opposed to after ever single commit.  It could also be on a nightly build perhaps if you desire.\n\n\nStages / Jobs / Tasks\n\n\nThis plan consists of 1 Job, 1 Stage and 2 Tasks\n\n\n\n\nTask 1: \nSource Code Checkout\n\n\nTask 2: \nScript\n (\ncarthage update\n)\n\n\n\n\nArtifact definitions\n\n\nCreate a shared artifact with the following info:\n\n\n\n\nName:\n CarthageFolder\n\n\nLocation:\n (leave blank) \n\n\nCopy Pattern:\n Carthage/Build/** \n\n\n\n\nOptional\n: You may want to automatically make the \nFastlane Plan\n trigger whenever this plan is built\n\n\nFastlane Plan\n\n\nWhen configuring fastlane to run in this setup you need to make sure that you are not calling either:\n\n\nreset_git_repo(force: true)\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nensure_git_status_clean\n\n\n\n\nas these calls will either fail the build or delete the \nCarthage\n directory.  Additionally you want to remove any \ncarthage\n tasks from inside your \nFastfile\n as \ncarthage\n is now happening externally to the build.\n\n\nBuild plan setup\n\n\nWhat this build plan does is it checks out the source code, then it downloads the entire \nCarthage/Build/\n directory into your local project - which is exactly what would be created from \ncarthage bootstrap\n and then it runs \nfastlane\n\n\n\n\nTask 1: \nSource Code Checkout\n\n\nTask 2: \nArtifact Download\n\n\nTask 3: \nFastlane",

You can call lanes of the same platform or a general lane outside of the \nplatform\n definition.\n\n\nPassing parameters is optional.\n\n\nReturning values\n\n\nAdditionally, you can retrieve the return value. In Ruby, the last line of the \nlane\n definition is the return value. Here is an example:\n\n\nlane :deploy do |options|\n  value = calculate(value: 3)\n  puts value # =\n 5\nend\n\nlane :calculate do |options|\n  ...\n  2 + options[:value] # the last line will always be the return value\nend\n\n\n\n\nbefore_each\n and \nafter_each\n blocks\n\n\nbefore_each\n blocks are called before any lane is called.

This would include being called after each lane you've switched to.\nJust like \nafter_all\n, \nafter_each\n is not called if an error occurs.

You might not be able to set some kind of parameters using this method.\n\n\nShell values\n\n\nYou can get value from shell commands:\n\n\noutput = sh(\npod update\n)\n\n\n\n\nPriorities of parameters and options\n\n\nThe order in which \nfastlane\n tools take their values from\n\n\n\n\nCLI parameter (e.g. \ngym --scheme Example\n) or Fastfile (e.g. \ngym(scheme: 'Example')\n)\n\n\nEnvironment variable (e.g. \nGYM_SCHEME\n)\n\n\nTool specific config file (e.g. \nGymfile\n containing \nscheme 'Example'\n)\n\n\nDefault value (which might be taken from the \nAppfile\n, e.g. \napp_identifier\n from the \nAppfile\n)\n\n\nIf this value is required, you'll be asked for it (e.g. you have multiple schemes, you'll be asked for it)\n\n\n\n\nImporting another Fastfile\n\n\nWithin your \nFastfile\n you can import another \nFastfile\n using 2 methods:\n\n\nimport\n\n\nImport a \nFastfile\n from a local path\n\n\nimport \n../GeneralFastfile\n\n\noverride_lane :from_general do\n  ...\nend\n\n\n\n\nimport_from_git\n\n\nImport from another git repository, which you can use to have one git repo with a default \nFastfile\n for all your project\n\n\nimport_from_git(url: 'https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/fastlane')\n# or\nimport_from_git(url: 'git@github.com:MyAwesomeRepo/MyAwesomeFastlaneStandardSetup.git',\n               path: 'fastlane/Fastfile')\n\nlane :new_main_lane do\n  ...\nend\n\n\n\n\nThis will also automatically import all the local actions from this repo.\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou should import the other \nFastfile\n on the top above your lane declarations. When defining a new lane \nfastlane\n will make sure to not run into any name conflicts. If you want to overwrite an existing lane (from the imported one), use the \noverride_lane\n keyword. \n\n\nEnvironment Variables\n\n\nYou can define environment variables in a \n.env\n or \n.env.default\n file in the same directory as your \nFastfile\n. Environment variables are loading using \ndotenv\n. Here's an example.\n\n\nWORKSPACE=YourApp.xcworkspace\nHOCKEYAPP_API_TOKEN=your-hockey-api-token\n\n\n\n\nfastlane\n also has a \n--env\n option that allows loading of environment specific \ndotenv\n files. \n.env\n and \n.env.default\n will be loaded before environment specific \ndotenv\n files are loaded. The naming convention for environment specific \ndotenv\n files is \n.env.\nenvironment\n\n\nFor example, \nfastlane \nlane-name\n --env development\n will load \n.env\n, \n.env.default\n, and \n.env.development\n\n\nLane Context\n\n\nThe different actions can \ncommunicate\n with each other using a shared hash. You can access them in your lanes with the following code.\n\n\nReplace \nVARIABLE_NAME_HERE\n with any of the following.\n\n\nlane_context[SharedValues::LANE_NAME]                 # The name of the current lane (stays the same when switching lanes)\nlane_context[SharedValues::BUILD_NUMBER]              # Generated by `increment_build_number`\nlane_context[SharedValues::VERSION_NUMBER]            # Generated by `increment_version_number`\nlane_context[SharedValues::SNAPSHOT_SCREENSHOTS_PATH] # Generated by `snapshot`\nlane_context[SharedValues::PRODUCE_APPLE_ID]          # The Apple ID of the newly created app\nlane_context[SharedValues::IPA_OUTPUT_PATH]           # Generated by `gym`\nlane_context[SharedValues::DSYM_OUTPUT_PATH]          # Generated by `gym`\nlane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_PROFILE_PATH]         # Generated by `sigh`\nlane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_UDID]                 # The UDID of the generated provisioning profile\nlane_context[SharedValues::HOCKEY_DOWNLOAD_LINK]      # Generated by `hockey`\n````\n\nTo get information about the available lane variables, run `fastlane action [action_name]`.\n\n# Private lanes\n\nSometimes you might have a lane that is used from different lanes, for example:\n\n```ruby\nlane :production do\n  ...\n  build(release: true)\n  appstore # Deploy to the AppStore\n  ...\nend\n\nlane :beta do\n  ...\n  build(release: false)\n  crashlytics # Distribute to testers\n  ...\nend\n\nlane :build do |options|\n  ...\n  ipa\n  ...\nend\n\n\n\n\nIt probably doesn't make sense to execute the \nbuild\n lane directly using \nfastlane build\n. You can hide this lane using\n\n\nprivate_lane :build do |options|\n  ...\nend\n\n\n\n\nThis will hide the lane from:\n\n\n\n\nfastlane lanes\n\n\nfastlane list\n\n\nfastlane docs\n\n\n\n\nAnd also, you can't call the private lane using \nfastlane build\n.\n\n\nThe resulting private lane can only be called from another lane using the lane switching technology.\n\n\nHide the \nfastlane\n folder\n\n\nJust rename the folder to \n.fastlane\n in case you don't want it to be visible in the Finder.\n\n\nLoad own actions from external folder\n\n\nAdd this to the top of your \nFastfile\n.\n\n\nactions_path '../custom_actions_folder/'\n\n\n\n\nSkip update check when launching \nfastlane\n\n\nYou can set the environment variable \nFASTLANE_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK\n to skip the update check.\n\n\nAdding Credentials\n\n\nYou can add credentials for use by \nfastlane\n to your keychain using the \nCredentialsManager\n command line interface.

In addition, working on the following things are super valuable:\n\n\nVerifying Bug Reports\n\n\nAre you able to reproduce this problem on your computer? If so, chime in! If the original issue report is a bit vague, but you have some additional details, please contribute them! If you find a bug report without an example script or configuration, contribute one that can be used to reproduce it.\n\n\nIf you're comfortable diving into the code a bit, see if you can produce a failing test that illustrates the bad behavior in the problematic area of the code! Tests live in the \nspec/\n directory, and are generally named relative to the source code files whose functionality they test. Once you are done, \ngit diff \n my_patch.diff\n can be used to produce a patch file containing the details of your changes, which can be added to the issue.\n\n\nTesting Proposed Fixes\n\n\nAnother way to help out is to verify submitted pull requests. To do that, you'll need to be able to get the author's proposed changes onto your machine. Start by giving yourself a new branch to work in:\n\n\ngit checkout -b testing_branch\n\n\n\n\nNext, you'll need to tell git where to find this contributor's fastlane fork and branch. Let's say that the contributor's username is \nJohnSmith\n and their topic branch is called \nnew_fastlane_action\n located at \nhttps://github.com/JohnSmith/fastlane\n. You can use the following commands to pull their work:\n\n\ngit remote add JohnSmith https://github.com/JohnSmith/fastlane.git\ngit pull JohnSmith new_fastlane_action\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have their changes locally, there's many things worth checking on:\n\n\n\n\nDoes the change work?\n\n\nAre there adequate tests to cover the changes or new functionality? Are the tests clear and testing the right things?\n\n\nIs the related documentation updated? New actions get described in \ndocs/Actions.md\n, for example.\n\n\nHow does the code look to you? Can you think of a nicer or more performant way to implement part of it?\n\n\n\n\nIf you're happy with what you see, leave a comment on the GitHub issue stating your approval. If not, leave a polite suggestion for what you think could be improved and how. The more you can show that you've reviewed the content seriously, the more valuable it will be to the author and other reviewers!\n\n\nPull Requests (PRs)\n\n\nPull requests are always welcome :smile:\n\n\nPRs should reference an open GitHub issue (preferably those marked with the \nhelp wanted\n label). Referring to the issue in the description of your PR is required and is really helpful for establishing the context needed for review.\n\n\nIf you're considering contributing new functionality, please open a new issue explaining the functionality desired first so that we can discuss as a community. We'll add the \nhelp wanted\n label if we believe this to be a meaningful contribution that will benefit other fastlane users and you go ahead with the pull request. :raised_hands:\n\n\n\n\nAdding automated tests that cover your changes and/or new functionality is important!\n\n\nfastlane\n has a lot of moving parts and receives contributions from many developers. The best way to ensure that your contributions keep working is to ensure that there will be failing tests if something accidentally gets broken.\n\n\nYou can run the tests by executing \nbundle install\n and then \nbundle exec rspec\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour code editor should indent using spaces with a tab size of 2 spaces.\n\n\n\n\nTo submit the changes to the fastlane repo, you have to do the following:\n\n\n\n\nRun \ngit push upstream master\n.\n\n\nOpen \nhttps://github.com/fastlane/fastlane\n in your browser and click the green \"Create Pull Request\" button\n\n\n\n\nWhat Do All These Labels Mean?\n\n\nGreat question! Check out the \nGitHub Labels\n document for a quick summary of the labels we use and what they mean.\n\n\nWhy Did My Issue/PR Get Closed?\n\n\nIt's not you, it's us! fastlane and its related tools receive a lot of issues and PRs. In order to effectively work through them and give each the prompt attention it deserves, we need to keep a sharp focus on the work we have outstanding.\n\n\nOne way we do this is by closing issues that we don't feel are immediately actionable. This might mean that we need more information in order to investigate (Have you provided enough information for us to reproduce the problem? The \nNew Issues\n section has the details!). Or, it might mean that we haven't been able to reproduce it using the provided info. In this case we might close the issue while we wait for others to reproduce the problem and possibly provide some more info that unlocks the mystery.\n\n\nIn any case, \na closed issue is not necessarily the end of the story!\n If more info becomes available after an issue is closed, it can be reopened for further consideration.\n\n\nOne of the best ways we can keep fastlane an approachable, stable, and dependable tool is to be deliberate about how we choose to modify it. If we don't adopt your changes or new feature into fastlane, that doesn't mean it was bad work! It may be that the fastlane philosophy about how to accomplish a particular task doesn't align well with your approach. The best way to make sure that your time is well spent in contributing to fastlane is to \nstart your work\n on a modification or new feature \nby opening an issue to discuss the problem or shortcoming with the community\n. The fastlane maintainers will do our best to give early feedback about whether a particular goal and approach is likely to be something we want to adopt!\n\n\nContributing New Actions\n\n\nThere are different approaches to build your own \nfastlane\n actions. You can either build your own local actions, or provide your own fastlane plugin. For more information, check out \nPlugins.md\n.\n\n\nDeveloping\n\n\nWhen working on something, directly edit the Ruby files in the project folders. Make sure to switch your text editor to use spaces and indentations should be 2 spaces.\n\n\nTo run the modified version of the tool, run the following in the project directory\n\n\n.[tool_name]/bin/[tool_name]\n\n\n\n\nor install the local copy (might require \nsudo\n)\n\n\nbundle install \n rake install\n\n\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nI personally use a plain Sublime Text with a terminal. Debugging is pretty easy, just insert the following code to where you want to jump in:\n\n\nrequire 'pry'\nbinding.pry\n\n\n\n\nYou then jump into an interactive debugger that allows you to print out variables, call methods and much more. Continue running the original script using \ncontrol\n + \nd\n\n\nRunning tests\n\n\nIn the directory of one project, run the tests using\n\n\nrake test_all\n\n\nThis will do a few things:\n\n\n\n\nRuns the tests (you can run them via \nrspec\n too)\n\n\nMakes sure no debug code (like \npry\n) is still there\n\n\nThe \n--help\n command works as expected\n\n\n\n\nThe tests are executed using \nfastlane\n :rocket:\n\n\nTo run only a subset of the tests, you can add the \nnow: true\n keyword to the test\n\n\nit \nraises an exception if it rains\n, now: true do\n  ...\nend\n\n\n\n\nand then run these tests only using\n\n\nrspec -t now\n\n\n\n\nrubocop validation\n\n\nThe \nfastlane\n repos use \nrubocop\n to validate the code style.\n\n\nThe style validation is automatically done when running \nrake test_all\n.\n\n\nTo automatically fix common code style issues (e.g. wrong spacing), run \nrubocop -a\n\n\nNeed help?\n\n\nPlease submit an \nissue\n on GitHub and provide information about your setup\n\n\nCode of Conduct\n\n\nHelp us keep \nfastlane\n open and inclusive. Please read and follow our \nCode of Conduct\n.\n\n\nAbove All, Thanks for Your Contributions\n\n\nThank you for reading to the end, and for taking the time to contribute to the project!
